    <h1>What is CanSat</h1>
    <h2>A group of TY and 5th year students form a team of 3-6 people and design a circuit along with a can that is tested using a rocket, mastering skills in engineering and coding. 
      The team's primary mission is to collect data on altitude and temperature throughout the descent of the can. 
      The secondary mission can involve anything from AI recognition to air quality monitoring, which is what our team based our secondary mission on. 
      Working alongside my peers, we transformed mere concepts into tangible realities, crafting a miniature satellite poised to soar into the heavens. 
      Our CanSat adventure not only fostered a deeper understanding of STEM principles but also nurtured invaluable skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability. 
      If you're searching for an enjoyable competition that blends STEM education with real life experience, look no further than the CanSat competition!</h2>
